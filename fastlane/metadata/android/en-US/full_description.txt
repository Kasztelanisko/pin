A minimalistic note-taking app utilizing your phone's notification area:

<ul>
<li>Take notes and save them as notifications</li>
<li>Edit those pins</li>
<li>Delete them</li>
<li>Hide them for a specific period of time</li>
</ul>

The app was build with <b>Material Design</b> in mind.

All notes are stored in the app's database and survive reboots.

<b>Troubleshooting</b>

If your pins do not reappear directly after startup open the app because on some devices <b>p!n</b> may not be able to start in background.
In this case try to enable 'Autostart' or disable some battery optimizations for this app.
