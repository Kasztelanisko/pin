# ![App Icon](app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png) p!n

A minimalistic note-taking app utilizing your phone's notification area:

* Take notes and save them as notifications
* Edit pinned notices
* Delete pins
* Hide notes for a specific period of time

The app was built with __Material Design__ in mind.

All notes are stored in the app's database and survive reboots.

## Troubleshooting

If your pins do not reappear directly after start-up, open the app because on some devices __p!n__ may not be able to start in background.
In this case try to enable 'Autostart' or disable some battery optimizations for this application.

A good resource for more information on this topic and solutions for various devices I have found [here](https://dontkillmyapp.com/).
