# p!n
![App Icon](app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)

A minimalistic note-taking app utilizing your phone's notification area:

* Take notes and save them as notifications
* Edit those pins
* Delete them
* Hide them for a specific period of time

The app was built with __Material Design__ in mind.

All notes are stored in the app's database and survive reboots.

## Troubleshooting

If your pins do not reappear directly after startup open the app because on some devices __p!n__ may not be able to start in background.
In this case try to enable 'Autostart' or disable some battery optimizations for this app.
