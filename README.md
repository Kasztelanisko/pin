# p!n
![App Icon](app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)

A minimalistic notetaking app to organize your day:

* Take notes and pin them to your phone's notification area
* Edit them in case you've got something wrong
* Delete them when you're done
* Hide them for a spezified amount of time

The app was built with modern __Material Design__ language in mind.

## Troubleshooting

On some devices __p!n__ may not be able to start in background because of agressive energy saving implemented by the manufacturer.
In this case try to enable 'Autostart' or disable some battery optimizations for this app.
